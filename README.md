# kant: A tracker for design docs

Cribbing from [tom][Tom Limoncelli], it's good to "think before you
do." One way to reflect this is by writing up Design Docs.

Kant is a simple tracker for some of these documents.

Nothing fancy, it's just support to work. It's an express app relying
on mongoose (mongo) for the storage.
